# noiseMaker
Noise maker that uses piano notes.
This code sets up a simple piano-like interface on a webpage. When different colors are clicked, corresponding piano sounds are played, and a visual effect is displayed on the screen. The sounds are represented by HTML elements with the class "sound", and the color pads are represented by HTML elements with the class "pads div". The visual effect is created by dynamically adding and removing div elements with different background colors. The code uses JavaScript event listeners to detect when a color pad is clicked and plays the corresponding sound. After playing the sound, it creates a bubble-like visual effect with the corresponding color that jumps on the screen for 1 second before being removed. Overall, this code provides an interactive and visually appealing piano-like experience on a webpage.
